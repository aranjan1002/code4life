Pseudo codes for operations on hmpoint
Note . Here, I have not explained how the input or output is represented. My only focus is on the algorithms
1) Deftime: Set of time intervals in which the hmpoint exists
Output - array of intervals

Return the lifetime of hmpoint

2) Trajectory: Projection of a moving point into a plane yielding a line	
Output - line

declare result as a line
for each upoint
    for each mpoi
    	result = result union mpoi
return result

3) At_instance: Returns the position of a moving point at a given historical instant of time
Input :- time instant	
Output :- point(s)
