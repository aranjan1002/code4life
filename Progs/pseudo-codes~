Pseudo codes for operations on hmpoint
Note . Here, I have not explained how the input or output is represented. My only focus is on the algorithms
1)   Deftime: Set of time intervals in which the hmpoint exists
Return the lifetime of hmpoint
2)     Trajectory: Projection of a moving point into a plane yielding a line	

for each upoint
    for each mpoi
    	add the mpoi to the
