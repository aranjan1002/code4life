function  inout1()
% Solve a production planning problem minimizing cost
%
% A company has to produce 3 products, using 2 resources.
%
% Each resource has a limited capacity.
% Each product consumes a given number of machines.
% Each product has a production cost (the inside cost).
% Both products can also be bought outside the company at a given
% cost (the outside cost).
%
% Minimize the total cost so that the company exactly meets the demand.
