The file containing the main function is
Standardize.cpp

You can either execute make command or type the following to compile
g++ -o standardize.o Standardize.cpp

In order to test the program for output using the difftest.pl, you can execute the following:
./difftest.pl -1 "rpal/rpal FILE" -2 "./standardize.o FILE" -t rpal/tests/ -r results -v 2

The following switches work and have the same functionality as rpal

-ast
-st
-noout

Thanks.
