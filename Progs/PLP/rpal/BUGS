This is a list of known bugs in this RPAL interpreter.

1.  let A = 1 in Print (+ A 1)
    The wrong tree is built, instead of disallowing this syntactically.

2.  (fn n.n <1 -> -n|n) (-3) 
    This yields an inappropriate parsing error message, unless one inserts
    a space between the '<' and the '1'.


3.  Print (true eq false)
    According to the documentation, this should be allowed.
