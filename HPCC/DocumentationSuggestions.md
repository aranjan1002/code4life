# Suggestions for documentations

* I think it would be a great source of understanding ECL if each of the operators explained in here (http://hpccsystems.com/download/docs/ecl-language-reference/html) also contains examples of how it behaves on a given dataset. For example, we have an example dataset on which we can do these operation, and what changes are made with execution of each of these operations. There should be examples for each use of the given operator.
* I do not have a complete understanding of Owned, Link and setClear etc. I think this needs a proper documentation with good examples. I understand that while Link increases the link count, Owned decreases it by once once Owned is out of scope. 
Other than Owned how does the link count decreases. Maybe a small documentation regarding its use will help. 
* It will be a good idea to have a documentation for each node_operator. Are they all associated with an activity?
